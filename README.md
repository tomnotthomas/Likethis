# LikeThis

A simple npm library that provides an intuitive function for creating short sentences about who liked a post, status, or any object that can be 'liked'.

## 🚀 Features

- Handles the case where nobody liked it
- Lists up to two people who liked it
- For more than two people, it lists two people and indicates how many others liked it.

## 💾 Installation

To install this package, use the following command:

npm install likethis


## 📖 Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the `likeThis` function.

```javascript
const likeThis = require('likethis');

const names = ['John', 'Jane', 'Sam', 'Alice', 'Bob'];
console.log(likeThis(names));
// Outputs: 'John, Jane and 3 others like this'

```
## 🧩 Functionality
The likeThis function takes an array of names as input, which represents the people who liked an object. Depending on the number of people who liked it, the function returns a string with a different format.

```Javascript
If nobody liked it, it returns 'no one likes this'.
If one person liked it, it returns '[name] likes this'.
If two people liked it, it returns '[name1] and [name2] like this'.
If three people liked it, it returns '[name1], [name2] and [name3] like this'.
If more than three people liked it, it returns '[name1], [name2] and [number of others] others like this'.
```
